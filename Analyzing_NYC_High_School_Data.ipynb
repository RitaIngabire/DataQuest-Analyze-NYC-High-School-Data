    "# 1) INTRODUCTION \n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year.  \n",
    "The SAT has three sections, each of which is worth a maximum of 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually indicative of a good school.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets.  \n",
    "Here's a link to the data https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4.  \n",
    "Over the last three missions, we combined the following data sets into a single, clean pandas dataframe:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City\n",
    "2. School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City\n",
    "3. Class size - Information on class size for each school\n",
    "4. AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam  \n",
    "   in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)\n",
    "5. Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information\n",
    "6. Demographics - Demographic information for each school\n",
    "7. School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school  \n",
    "\n",
    "New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race,  \n",
    "income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.  \n",
    "For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last mission, we began performing some analysis.  \n",
    "We'll extend that analysis in this mission.  \n",
    "As you can see, we've included the code to read in all of the data, combine it, and create correlations in the notebook.  \n",
    "The dataframe **combined** contains all of the data we'll be using in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Set up matplotlib to work in Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "+ There are several fields in **combined** that originally came from a survey of parents, teachers, and students.  \n",
    "  Make a bar plot of the correlations between these fields and sat_score.\n",
    "  You can find a list of the fields in the **survey_fields** variable in the notebook.\n",
    "+ Consult the data dictionary that's part of the zip file you can download from the City of New York's website.                     https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8\n",

    "# 15) Filling in Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the inner joins resulted in 116 fewer rows in **sat_results**.  \n",
    "**This is because pandas couldn't find the DBN values that existed in sat_results in the other data sets.**  \n",
    "While this is worth investigating, we're currently looking for high-level correlations,so we don't need to dive into which DBNs are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have noticed that we now have many columns with null (NaN) values.  \n",
    "This is because we chose to do left joins, where some columns may not have had data.  \n",
    "The data set also had some missing values to begin with.  \n",
    "If we hadn't performed a left join, all of the rows with missing data would have been lost in the merge process, which wouldn't have left us with many high schools in our data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to handle missing data, and we'll cover them in more detail later on.  \n",
    "For now, we'll just fill in the missing values with the **overall mean** for the column.\n",
    "We replace the missing values with the means of their respective columns, which allows us to  \n",
    "proceed with analyses that can't handle missing values (like correlations).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fill in missing data in pandas using the **pandas.DataFrame.fillna()** method.  \n",
    "This method will replace any missing values in a dataframe with the values we specify.  \n",
    "We can compute the mean of every column using the **pandas.DataFrame.mean()** method.  \n",
    "If we pass the results of the **df.mean()** method into the **df.fillna()** method, pandas will fill in the missing values in each column with the mean of that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how we would accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```means = df.mean()\n",
    "df = df.fillna(means)```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if a column consists entirely of null or NaN values, pandas won't be able to fill in the missing values when we use the **df.fillna()** method along with the **df.mean()** method, because there won't be a mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should fill any NaN or null values that remain after the initial replacement with the value 0.  \n",
    "We can do this by passing 0 into the **df.fillna()** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Calculate the means of all of the columns in combined using the **pandas.DataFrame.mean()** method.\n",
